Welcome to 80's Tower Defense!
----------------------------------------------------------------
Your objective is to survive as long as possible in this exciting strategy game.

Relive the 80's with notable themes and soundtracks from that time period, feel like you're in the arcade again.

While you listen to synth wave music, enjoy using turrets with a TRON style appearance to take down recognizable game enemies from the 80s with 
the modernized versions of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde from smash hit franchise, "Pac-Man".

Place down turrets with “records” and ensure that you don’t run out of “cassettes” by eliminating enemies, progress until you can't anymore!
----------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PLAY:
You begin the game with 650 "records", "records" are your currency in this game. Each turret will cost you 150 records, and upgrading them will cost you 75.
You also begin with 100 "cassettes", "cassettes" are your hearts in this game, every enemy that gets to the end costs you 1 "cassette".

Using these records, you can buy turrets, place down a couple of turrets and press "Start Round", the enemies will now begin to spawn.
You now watch the turrets as they destroy your foe!

That's the game! Progress by placing more turrets down and upgrading the turrets. Upgrading turrets increases their radius and fire rate.

ENEMY TYPES:
As you progress, you will begin to notice the rest of the Pac-Man crew.

In order, these are the enemies from weakest to strongest:
Weakest - Pinky
Weaker - Inky
Stronger - Clyde
Strongest - Blinky

As you progress, the enemies will get faster and stronger, ensure you have enough turrets and them upgraded enough to be able to withstand the upgraded enemies!
